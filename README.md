# plugin-gimp-fourier

Plugin GIMP : Fourier Transform

## What it does

It does a direct and reverse Fourier Transform.
It allows you to work in the frequency domain.
For instance, it can be used to remove moiré patterns from images scanned from books. (See [README.Moire](README.Moire))

## Use 

It adds 2 items in the filters menu:
*  Filters/Generic/FFT Forward
*  Filters/Generic/FFT Inverse

## Installation

### Linux

You will need the fftw3 package, and the development packages of gimp, fftw3, and glib  
For instance, on debian/ubuntu : `sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libgimp2.0-dev`

Then if you cloned this repo, starts with the commands below. 
If you downloaded the tar package, you may skip this step and go to the second one.
```sh
autoreconf -i  (or use 'autoreconf --install --force' for more modern setups)
automake --foreign -Wall
```

And then:
```sh
./configure 
make
make strip
sudo make install
```

If you have non-standard GIMP plug-ins directory, you may have to add `--bindir=/usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins` to the configure command (replace by your plug-ins path)

There is also a pre-built package from the Fedora community to be installed with `sudo yum install gimp-fourier-plugin`, 
and an experimental package for opensuse, slack, ArchLinuw, Enterprise Linux, Guix and NixOS.



### Windows
 
Binaries for windows are provided as separate packages. Please download the 32bits or 64bits according to you GIMP version 
(this is not related to Windows version). Altough the GIMP API is quite stable, the binaries are not, and the plugin binaries 
must be updated to new GIMP versions (some will work, some won't). The GIMP version is indicated in the package filename. 
Download the binaries that fits the best to your GIMP version. Just copy the files (fourier.exe and libfftw3-3.dll) in the 
plugins directory of eiher:
- your personal gimp directory (ex: .gimp-2.2\plug-ins), 
- or in the global directory (C:\Program Files\GIMP-2.2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins)

You can also build with msys2 environment:
```
msys2 -c "pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-toolchain"
msys2 -c "pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-gimp=2.10.24"
msys2 -c "pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-fftw"
msys2 -mingw32 -c 'echo $(gimptool-2.0 -n --build fourier.c) -lfftw3 -O3 | sh'
```

This is for 32bits version ; replace i686 by x84_64 and -mingw32 by -mingw64 if you want 64bits. 
Replace also 2.10.24 by your GIMP version (or leave empty for latest version)

Also, the windows binaries are build through GitHub Actions. So you may also fork this repository and build the plugin on your own.


## Maintainers:

To create a distributable fourier-{version}.tar.gz file, you  will need to do these steps:
First, update the MAJOR.MINOR version in configure.ac, and then:

```
$  wget -O config.guess 'https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD'
$  wget -O config.sub 'https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD'
$ autoreconf -i
$ automake --foreign -Wall
$ ./configure
$ make dist
$ ls -l
```

You should see a tar file named fourier-0.4.3.tar.gz in the directory. Ccopy fourier-0.4.3.tar.gz to your release webpage.

Many thanks to Mogens Kjaer, Alex Fernández, Rene Rebe, Edgar Bonet,
Martin Ramshaw, Bob Barry, bluedxca93 and JoesCat for their contributions.

French readers may also interested by [this article](https://www.lprp.fr/2002/02/fourier/) that describes 
the way the plugin works (even it is a little outdated as a GIMP parasite is used to store the scale 
factor instead of the former 'magic pixel')
